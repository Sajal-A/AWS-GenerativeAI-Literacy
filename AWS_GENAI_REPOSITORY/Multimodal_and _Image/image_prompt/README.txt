# Image Generation

- We will build a basic image generator using Amazon Nova Canvas, Amazon Bedrock, and Streamlit. 
We'll be using the Boto3 library to interact with Nova Canvas.

- Nova Canvas creates images from a text prompt. It starts with random noise and gradually forms an image over a series of steps. 
It can also be used to transform existing images based on a prompt.

## Use cases

The image generation pattern is good for the following use cases:

	- Creation of custom imagery for websites, emails, etc.
	- Creation of concept art for various media forms.
