# Image Style Mixing 
 - We will build an image style mixing application using Amazon Nova Canvas, 
Amazon Bedrock, and Streamlit. We'll be using the Boto3 library to interact with Nova Canvas.

- Nova Canvas can take several images and create variations based on those images. 
This can be helpful when you have images with the elements you want, but want to create 
some alternative options with combined styles or elements.

- The image style mixing pattern is good for the following use cases:

	- Creating alternate versions of images for marketing content, stock photography use cases, and concept art.
