# Image Variation

- We will build an image variation application using Amazon Nova Canvas, Amazon Bedrock, and Streamlit. We'll be using the Boto3 library to interact with Nova Canvas.

- Nova Canvas can take an existing image and create variations based on that image. This can be helpful when you have an image with the elements you want, 
but want to create some alternative options with similar characteristics.

## Use cases

- The image variation pattern is good for the following use cases:

	- Creating alternate versions of images for marketing content, stock photography use cases, and concept art.
