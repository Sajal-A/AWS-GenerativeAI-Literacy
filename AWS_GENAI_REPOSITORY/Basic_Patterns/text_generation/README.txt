# Text Generation App 
- We will build a simple text generator with Amazon Bedrock and Streamlit. 
- We will collect user input, pass it to Amazon Bedrock, and return the foundation model’s response. 
- While this is a fairly trivial example, it allows us to understand how to build a basic generative AI prototype with very little code.

- The basic text generation pattern is good for the following use cases:

	- General content creation, where factuality isn't critical.
	- Basic question & answer for well-known facts that are repeated frequently on the internet.
