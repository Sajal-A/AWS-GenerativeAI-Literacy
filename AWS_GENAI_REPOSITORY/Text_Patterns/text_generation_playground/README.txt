# Text Playground
- We will build a text playground with Amazon Nova Micro and Streamlit. We will collect user input and inference parameters, pass it to Amazon Bedrock, and return Amazon Nova Micro’s response. 
This application gives the end user direct control of the inference parameters.

# Use Case

- The text generation playground is good for the following use cases:

- Developers cannot access the AWS console, but want to experiment with different prompts and inference parameters.
