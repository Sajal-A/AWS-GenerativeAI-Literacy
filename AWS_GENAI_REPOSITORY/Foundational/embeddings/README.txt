# Embeddings

Embeddings capture the meaning of a piece of text in a series of numbers called a vector. 
We can then use these vectors to determine how similar pieces of text are to each other.

We can use a vector database to store these embeddings and perform fast similarity searches.
Embeddings paired with a vector database are a core component of retrieval-augmented generation.
