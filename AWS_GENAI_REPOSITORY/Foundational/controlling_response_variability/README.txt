# Temperature

-Temperature is an inference parameter that influences the variability of the responses generated by a foundation model.
-  You can think of temperature as a way to control the creativity & variability of the model. 
A temperature of 0 means no variability - the current version* of the model will return a consistent response to the same prompt. 
The higher the temperature, the more variation in responses can be expected. In creative scenarios like content creation, a higher temperature 
can be helpful. In business process scenarios & code generation, a temperature of zero may be best.
